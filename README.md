# Datapacks
Some of my datapack that I made for Minecraft: Java Edition.
To make it easier to organize, I created a wiki section on this repository that can be found [here](https://github.com/NobodyCentral/Datapacks/wiki).

# Woah, license! That's scary!
The only thing the license means is that this is freeware. Feel free to copy/modify the code in any way, shape or form. If you do, you don't have to credit me, but it would be nice if you did.
